    To make a long story short, we do not sell any of your data. It's Just Earth believes everyone's interaction with the internet is a private experience and in order to protect each user all geographical data is stored locally. This means that the data we use (your location) is stored in the current session of use e.g., the moment you close out of the browser is the moment your data is gone. All in all, we do not keep any of your data to sell. In full transparency we do use analytical tools to better understand our audience and how the website is being used. Any data points taken are not assigned to an identity. For example, we can see how many visitors viewed a page but there is no way of knowing the exact person that accessed the page.
