                A Patron is a monthly donation being either $3, $7, $14 dollars a month that contributes to It's Just Earth and our mission. When you subscribe you join our "Forest of Supporters" and your donation tier gives you certain perks. Each tier is named after a tree commonly found in a PNW forest. As a Patron you can get early access to artwork, videos, and a link into our Discord server for conversations and updates about sustainability. Join us for conversations and updates on what we are doing. Interested? Go <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/user?u=93670993">here</a> to check out our Patreon page!

            Check out our <a href = "https://github.com/ItsJustArizona?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>, no seriously it's that simple. All our code (including little bits of software we made to make calculations easy on us) is available to everyone in the world for no charge. Can you use it? Absolutely! Only caveat is that if you use it, you can't make money off the use and we ask you credit the creator while using the available code. Even our artwork is openly available! In order to be sustainable our website does not include any paywalls, meaning we function entirely on donations (see more at the <a href = "patreon.com/user?u=93670993">donate</a> page).
