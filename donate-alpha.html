            Formed from the imagination of a Pacific North Westner, IJE was formed in Colorado and continues to be created in Ram country, Fort Collins. As a Colorado State University student, Arizona has attempted to shape the non-profit into a collaboration of society and nature. Everyday the IJE is worked on to enable better features availble to anyone with an internet connection. Future goals are to create models of water sources so people have an understanding of how much water they will expect to have in coming years.

            Check out our <a href = "https://github.com/ItsJustArizona?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>, no seriously it's that simple. All our code (including little bits of software we made to make calculations easy on us) is available to everyone in the world for no charge. Can you use it? Absolutely! Only caveat is that if you use it, you can't make money off the use and we ask you credit the creator while using the available code. Even our artwork is openly available! In order to be sustainable our website does not include any paywalls, meaning we function entirely on donations (see more at the <a href = "patreon.com/user?u=93670993">donate</a> page).
